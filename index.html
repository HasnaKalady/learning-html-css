       <p>

         The Tiger(Panthera tigris) <strong>is the largest living cat</strong> and member of the genus <em>Panthera</em>.It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
         </p> 
         <p>The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra. An adult tiger’s tail can grow up to 3.3 feet (1m) in length. It also uses its tail to communicate. If he is relaxed, then the tail hangs loosely. If he is feeling aggressive, he’ll move the tail quickly from side to side. Alternatively, he’ll hold it low and twitch it every once in a while. </p>

        <p>The tiger has good survival skills with strong eyesight. It has large pupils and lenses, which allows it to see clearly in the daytime. During the nighttime, the tiger can see six times more clearly than humans. This is why it will often hunt for prey at night. The tiger uses his powerful jaw to trap and kill prey. Each tiger has approximately 30 razor-sharp teeth in its mouth. Tigers have the largest canines of all big cat species. The canines can grow up to 3 inches (7.6cm) in length and are used to sever the prey’s neck. Back teeth are used to shear meat off the prey’s bone. The small, front incisors pick small pieces of meat and feathers from prey. The older the tiger, the more worn down the teeth get. In the wild if a tiger’s teeth are too worn down and become useless, he could die from starvation.</p>
